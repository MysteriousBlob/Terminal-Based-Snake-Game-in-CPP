# Terminal Based Snake Game

# Inspiration for this was https://github.com/NevilleBulmer/Terminal-Based-Snake-Game-In-CPP

To move use WASD: (This is not permanent)

W: Up

A: Right

S: Down

D: Right

#

The goal of the game is to fill all the tiles possible with your snake or
casually collect the fruits (They look like 'P') to score points,
it's honsetly up to you.


While collecting the fruits remember that your tail and walls are a obstacles,
so if you touch yourself or the walls it's game over!

That is my first ever project on GitHub and I hope you like it!

Thank you very much! <3
